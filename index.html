    Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web Application.Typically it refers to the 
    HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) and JavaScript portion of website production as opposed to the database or server-side programming. It encompasses everything from building a simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various 
    different browsers, devices and screen sizes.
